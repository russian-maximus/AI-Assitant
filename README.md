AI-Powered Question Answering -> Using an AI model (like Claude 3.5 Sonnet) to answer questions, provide information__
Custom Commands -> You can add additional commands to suit your needs.__

**Technologies Used**__

Python -> The core programming language for this project.__
SpeechRecognition -> For converting speech to text.__
pyttsx3 -> A text-to-speech conversion library for responding back to the user.__
AI/ML API -> To provide AI-based answers and conversations. (https://aimlapi.com)__

**How It Works**
